## **About the Project**

<hr />

### **Background**

This is an intern project created in order to gain experience in the workplace and to develop skills required for work life.

The company which we were working for, Nonlinear Dynamics, have a pool league running in the office where employees can play each other at 8-ball and 9-ball pool and compete for the league title.

### **Current System**

The employees currently use a spreadsheet to record all the results, view the league table, record payments, and create new seasons. A Trello board is used to arrange fixtures, and a Slack channel is where score updates are posted manually.

### **Solution**

The product which we have created solves the problems that the users once had with their spreadsheet.

One of the main problems faced was how manual each process was - after playing a match, one of the players would have to input the score into their spreadsheet, then update the league table, then post a message in the relevant Slack channel to inform others of the result. With this new system, the user can input a score and everything is updated automatically: the score is available to view on the app, the league table changes, and a message is posted automatically to the Slack channel.

In addition to fixing the problems of the old system, this product has extra features such as achievements, stats, form, and user profiles.

### **Built With:**

<ul>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>Node JS</li>
    <li>MSSQL</li>
</ul>
