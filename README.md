# Pool Manager

## **About the Project**

### **Background**

This is an intern project created in order to gain experience in the workplace and to develop skills required for work life.

The company we were working for have a pool league running in the office where employees can play each other at 8-ball and 9-ball pool and compete for the league title.

### **Current System**

The employees currently use a spreadsheet to record all the results, view the league table, record payments, and create new seasons. A Trello board is used to arrange fixtures, and a Slack channel is where score updates are posted manually.

### **Solution**

The product we have created solves the problems the users once had with their spreadsheet.

One of the main problems faced was how manual each process was. After playing a match, one of the players would have to input the score into their spreadsheet, then update the league table and post a message in the relevant Slack channel to inform others of the result. With this new system, the user can input a score and everything is updated automatically; the score is available to view on the app, the league table changes automatically, and a message is posted to the Slack channel on its own.

In addition to fixing the problems of the old system, this product has extra features such as achievements, stats, form, and user profiles.

## **Getting Started**

<hr />

**Client**

In the client directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the front end of the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

**Backend**

In the backend directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This is required as this allows the application to communicate with the database.
